# Walking Skeleton

A Walking Skeleton is a lightweight application framework w/o any product-specific functionality but that is still runnable and can exemplify the fundamental architectural patterns. Think of it as the simplest thing that can possibly work.

Completing a walking skeleton before the first sprint provides development teams w/ several important advantages:

* It puts some architectural building blocks together, exhibiting structure and patterns.

* It establishes the fundamental technologies and proves the basics work.

* It provides fodder for continuous integration and automated deployment.

* It can establish a common framework. 

The Walking Skeleton is used in prioritizing features in an MVP and defines which of them are absolutely critical for the product to work.

## Features

The method has distinct features that focus on user stories.

**Key features first.** When using the Walking Skeleton, a delivery team ranks the necessary user storied first.

**The system must function.** Due to the focus on the implementation of the essential points, the key functionality forms a fully operation product, w/o any additions.

**Reflects the business concept of a future product.** The Walking Skeleton advocates showing business value. That is why the story maps are lined up to display the core system elements within the restricted technical basis.

**Completed w/ tests.** Since the Walking Skeleton involves the whole production pipeline, including delivery and deployment, the testing is applied as well.

## Pros of Walking Skeleton

**Fast prioritization.** One of the key benefits of Walking Skeleton prioritization for stakeholders is that defining the core features won't take much time.

**Key functionality only.** When estimating the business value of a future product, it's often hard to focus on the core element, as there's always a temptation to make it as comprehensive as possible. The Walking Skeleton helps avoid this situation, putting the operating MVP w/ the greatest validity first.

**Fast market validation.** Arguably one of the most significant advantages for the Walking Skeleton is that its prioritization results help to quickly get the feedback from users. Therefore, the stakeholders assess the product-market fit and the business idea as a whole. In further releases, they can suit it up.

## Cons of Walking Skeleton

**Lacks important functionality.** While the basic working framework is included, the Walking Skeleton will not involve other additional though still important features. It might play a critical role at some point.

**Late first release.** Although the Walking Skeleton is a rather quick prioritization technique, the first release won't be fact as you still must ship a functioning product.

**The risk to cut corners.** When trying to roll out the basic version of a product as fast as possible, the stakeholders may try to refuse the basic functional functional features to accelerate the release. That is why when prioritizing the backlog, the team should focus on keeping the basics w/o omitting them in favor of fast delivery. Otherwise, the very first - and viable - product version is at risk of turning into a prototype that is not ready for the market.

## When to use

Walking Skeleton is extremely useful when releasing a Minimum Viable Product. Being good in tandem, these two can provide tangible results. However, Walking Skeleton is not the ont to rely on when delivering a more suitable and complex product w/ numerous extra features or additional business value. For the latter, the stakeholders should consider something more comprehensive and detailed.

## Functional Requirements related to Tic-Tac-Toe

Create a walking skeleton for the game of tic-tac-toe, that includes the following:

* A new repository that is checked into version control and accessible to the mentoring team.

* Any relevant packages are managed by a package manager rather than copy/pasted into the repo.

* A single passing test (this might be a dummy test that asserts true equals true).

* A detailed README outlining how to run the app and tests.

* A continuous integration service that runs the test suite upon every commit. *One suggestion is to use GitHub and GitHub Actions.*

* A simple message that is displayed on the console when the app is run (e.g. "Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe").
