* Determine what is wrong w/ the cluster

* Fix the problem.

Your company, BeeBox, has a new Kubernetes cluster that was just built by an outside contractor. Last night, someone restarted the servers used to run this cluster. Ever since the restart, some of your team members are reporting issues with one of the worker nodes. Unfortunately, the contractor is no longer working with the company, so you will need to find and fix the problem.

Explore the cluster and determine what is causing the issues. Then take steps to fix the problem and ensure that it does not happen again.
