1. How can we provide custom certificates to the Universal Control Plane (UCP) and Docker Trusted Registry (DTR)?

[ ] `docker ucp config --cert`

[ ] We can push new certificates via the UCP web API.

[ ] We must supply the certificates during the UCP and DTR installation process.

[x] We can upload certificates via the UCP and DTR web UIs.

> We can upload certificates in the administrative settings section for both UCP and DTR.
