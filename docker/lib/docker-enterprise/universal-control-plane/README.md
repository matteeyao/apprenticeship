# Setting up Universal Control Plane (UCP)

1. We have a group of people who need similar permissions in Universal Control Plane (UCP). How can we manage their permissions as a group without having to assign individual permissions to each user manually?

[ ] Create a GrantBundle and assign it to each user.

[x] Assign the users to a team, and then assign grants to the entire team, giving them the permissions they need.

[ ] Add grants to one user to give them the permissions they need, and then copy that user's permissions to the other users.

[ ] Create a role with several permissions assigned, and then assign each user to that shared role.

> UCP uses teams to manage users who all need the same set of permissions.
