# Flattening an Image

1. How can we flatten an existing multi-layered image into a single layer?

[ ] We can use the `--flatten` flag with the `docker build` command.

[ ] We can use a multi-stage build.

[ ] We would not include any `RUN` directives in our Dockerfile.

[x] We can run a container from the image, export it, and then import it as a new image.
