# Building a Docker Swarm

1. How would we create a new swarm cluster?

[ ] Use a Docker compose file that defines a new cluster.

[x] Run `docker swarm init`.

[ ] Start `dockerd` with the `swarm=true` flag.

[ ] Run `docker cluster create`.

> This command creates a new cluster and generates the current node inside the first Swarm manager.
