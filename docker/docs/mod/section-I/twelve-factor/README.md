# The Twelve-Factor App

## Introduction

In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called *web apps*, or *software-as-a-service*. The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:

* Use **declarative** formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new devs joining the project;

* Have a **clean contract** w/ the underlying operating system, offering **maximum portability** between execution environments;

* Are suitable for **deployment** on modern **cloud platforms**, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;

* **Minimize divergence** between development and production, enabling **continuous deployment** for maximum agility;

* And can **scale up** w/o significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.

The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services (database, queue, memory cache, etc).

## Background

This document synthesizes all out experience and observations on a wide variety of software-as-a-service apps in the wild. It is a triangulation on ideal practices for add development, paying particular attention to the dynamics of the organic growth of an app over time, the dynamics of collaboration between developers working on the app's codebase, and avoiding the cost of software erosion.

Our motivation is to raise awareness of some systemic problems weâ€™ve seen in modern application development, to provide a shared vocabulary for discussing those problems, and to offer a set of broad conceptual solutions to those problems with accompanying terminology.

## The Twelve Factors

**I. Codebase**
One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

**II. Dependencies**
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

**III. Config**
Store config in the environment

**IV. Backing services**
Treat backing services as attached resources

**V. Build, release, run**
Strictly separate build and run stages

**VI. Processes**
Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

**VII. Port binding**
Export services via port binding

**VIII. Concurrency**
Scale out via the process model

**IX. Disposability**
Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

**X. Dev/prod parity**
Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

**XI. Logs**
Treat logs as event streams

**XII. Admin processes**
Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
