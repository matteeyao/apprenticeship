# Use Case - Gaming application: Amazon DynamoDB

Companies in the gaming industry use Amazon DynamoDB in all aspects of game platforms, including game state, player data, session history, and leaderboards. Unlike Amazon RDS, DynamoDB is able to automatically scale to millions of concurrent users and requests while ensuring consistently low latency measured in single-digit milliseconds.

In this use case, player data is stored in DynamoDB for analytics to determine player behavior and usage patterns.

Use cases such as gaming, advertising tech, shopping carts, and IoT lend themselves particularly well to the key-value data model of DynamoDB.
