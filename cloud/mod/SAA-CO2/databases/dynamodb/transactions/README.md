# Transactions

> * Multiple "all-or-nothing" operations
>
> * Financial transactions
>
> * Fulfilling orders
>
> * Two underlying reads or writes - prepare/commit

* So when you're thinking about read and write capacity w/ your DynamoDB tables, keep in mind you're going to consume more of that capacity when working w/ transactions

> * Up to 25 items or 4 MB of data (at anytime)
