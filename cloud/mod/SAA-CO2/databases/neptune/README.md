# Use Case - Knowledge graph: Amazon Neptune

Amazon Neptune allows you to use existing information resources to build knowledge graphs and host them on a fully managed service. A knowledge graph allows you to store information in a graph model and use graph queries to enable your users to easily navigate highly connected datasets.

In this use case, comma-separated value (CSV) or Resource Description Framework (RDF) data is loaded from Amazon S3 to Neptune. The client application then uses simple SPARQL queries to build graphical visualizations.

Using a knowledge graph, you can add topical information to product catalogs, build and query complex models of regulatory rules, or model general information.
