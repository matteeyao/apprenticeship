# S3 Versioning

Using **Versioning** w/ S3:

* Versioning stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)

* Great backup

* Once enabled, **Versioning cannot be disabled**, only suspended

* Integrates w/ **Lifecycle** rules

* Versioning's **MFA Delete** capability, which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security
