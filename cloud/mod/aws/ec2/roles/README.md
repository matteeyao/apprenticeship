# Identity Access Management Roles

Roles enable us to interact w/ the AWS platform w/o having to pass our EC2 instances access key IDs and secret access keys. And roles aren't just used for EC2. They are used for every AWS service.

In this learning block, we are going to attach a role to an EC2 instance.

## Learning summary

> * Roles are more secure than storing your access key and secret access key on individual EC2 instances
>
> * Roles are easier to manage
>
> * Roles can be assigned to an EC2 instance after it is created using both the console and command line
>
> * Roles are universal - you can use them in any region
