# Tutorial: Create a Go module

In this tutorial you'll create two modules. The first is a library which is intended to be imported by other libraries or apps. The second is a caller app which will use the first

This tutorial's sequence includes seven brief topics that each illustrate a different part of the language

1. Create a module - Write a small module w/ functions you can call from another module

2. Call your code from another module - Import and use your new module

3. Return and handle an error - Add simple error handling

4. Return a random greeting - Handle data in slices (Go's dynamically-sized arrays)

5. Return greetings for multiple ppl - Stored key/value pairs in a map

6. Add a test - Use Go's built-in unit testing features to test your code

7. Compile and install the application - Compile and install your code locally
