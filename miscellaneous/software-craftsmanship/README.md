# Software craftsmanship

* The guild system worked for centuries

    * an effective means of propagating arcane knowledge

* Acknowledges that software is complicated

    * and getting more so

* Puts ppl back in the picture

    * instead of standardizing them away

* Recognizes that learning requires practice

## Ownership

**We have a vested interest in developing the best software solution** for its long-term sustainability, performance, and impact. We empower each other, our clients, and our communities to build a brighter future, together

## Implications of craftsmanship

* Pride of work and visibility

    * signing your work

* Taking responsibility

    * not hiding behind a license agreement

* Relationship to users

    * direct, not through intermediaries

* Reaching a mass market

    * advantage of software over other crafts

## Delivery dates & quality

* Software projects often miss deadlines

    * but less often miss estimates

* Unrealistic dates put craftsmen at risk

    * reputation is what they live by

* Shipping w/ bugs

    * comes from the "good enough" camp

* Select developers on quality, not cost

    * Deming's point about total cost, not project cost

## Sign your work

* Craftsman live by their reputation

    * customers will choose the best

    * developers will not work w/ bad customers

* Reputation requires visibility

    * open source as prime model

* Accountability for mistakes

    * learning requires feedback

## We're not all equal

* Software engineering is about managing large numbers of average developers

* Small teams of very good developers can produce amazing applications

* The best developer is 10x better than an average developer

    * so pay them 10x as much and hire 1/10 of them

## The need for iteration

* Iterative, incremental delivery is the only way

    * paying 10x average means high expectations

    * not sacrificing quality may mean schedule risk

* Small teams, combined with faster delivery, means less risk

    * than large teams w/ long delivery cycles

* Customers need to engage

    * or risk wasting very expensive developer time

## Do-it-Right versus Debugging

* Which release is better?

    * minimal features, rock-solid, functional

    * feature rich, unstable, buggy

* Debugging your way to stability

    * the "good enough" approach

* Booch's observation on complex working systems

* Aligning interests

    * customers want great software

    * craftsmen want to build great software

## Software Craftsmanship

* General skills versus specialization

    * complete job, start to finish, into maintenance

* A talented craftsman can know the system

    * Avoid the inefficiencies of specialization

* Pride of work means all aspects

* Craftsmanship requires mastery

    * more than skills and knowledge

    * attitude and commitment

    * learning new things, readily admitting mistakes

    * pass along knowledge

## Becoming a Craftsman

* Schools aren't good, since they mostly ignore

    * situated learning

    * legitimate peripheral participation

* Apprentice to a master

    * learn by doing real work

    * and from other apprentices

    * start simple, move up in task complexity as you learn

* Seek others who share passion, enthusiasm, and pride

## Characteristics of Mastery

* Becoming productive quickly in a new tech

* Years of experience delivering and maintaining

    * to gain insight into what makes a system last

* Not interested in unstable technologies

    * cult of the new works against long-lived apps

    * time to learn tools and tech must be paid off

* Willing to pass the craft along

    * 1 craftsman x 2 journeymen x 2 apprentices

## Humanity

**We bring a human-centered approach to software**, collaborating w/ the people writing the code as well as those using it. We embrace the need for adaptability in a constantly changing world. We share processes that empower your teams and build systems that are intuitive for users

## The Apprentice

* More about learning than teaching

    * load on the craftsman's productivity

    * self-reliant, coachable, enthusiastic

* Feedback from others

    * crucial to learning

    * reviewing work of the craftsman

* Ask good questions, bring new technologies

    * so apprentices contribute and teach as well

## Education

**We share the skills and best practices** that enable our clients to grow their business through a culture of continual learning

## The Journeyman

* When you've learned enough as apprentice

    * about technologies, practices, and craftsmanship

* But still have things to learn from craftsmen

    * and experience to gain

* Journeymen perform the bulk of work

    * working together, or w/ a craftsman

    * coaching and guiding apprentices

## What can software engineering teach craftsmanship?

* Size and complexity matter

    * reducing team size reduces communication and coordination burdens

    * modular decomposition helps w/ complexity

* Programming in the large is different

    * talented craftsmen and expressive language shifts the boundary of what is "large"

* Structure is important

    * OO was created to tackle complexity and size

    * Ditto decomposition and design patterns

* Change is inevitable

    * so embrace and handle it well (iterative process, incremental delivery)

* Change before delivery is risky and expensive

    * so deliver more frequently

* Communication within the team is crucial

    * so don't have teams spread across multiple sites

* Communication w/ customers is crucial

    * so co-locate them w/ developers

* Craftsmanship is personal

    * get people together

    * let them build trust

* Documentation is always wrong

    * so don't waste time producing it

    * produce documentation that will stay current (test suites)

    * keep the code readable

* Incremental development manages risk

    * tackle unknowns quickly

    * deliver early and often

* Accurate estimates are expensive

    * Initial estimates based on high level functional descriptions can be wrong by a factor of 4x

    * W/ main requirements identified, reduced to factor of 2x

    * W/ all requirements identified, reduced to factor of 1.5x

    * w/ detail design done, reduced to 1.25x

* Believe the initial estimates

    * Or alter the scope

## Conclusion

* Software craftsmanship offers an alternative model to software engineering

    * Respects the importance of the individual

    * Addresses the software crisis in a systemic fashion

    * Is a better match for most projects

    * Has a successful historical precedent
