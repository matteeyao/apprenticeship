# Containers

Containers are great at accomplishing:

* **Software Portability** - Running software consistently on different machines.

* **Isolation** - Keeping individual pieces of software separate from on another.

* **Scaling** - Increasing or decreasing resources allocated to software as needed.

* **Automation** - Automating processes to save time and money.

* **Efficient Resource Usage** - Containers use resources efficiently, which saves money.

  * Since containers use fewer resources than virtual machines, you can save money on cloud resources

## Advantages of Containers

* The **isolation** and **portability** of VMs.

* More **lightweight** than VMs - Less resource usage.

* **Faster** than VMs - Containers can start up in seconds, not minutes.

* **Smaller** than VMs - Container images can be measured in megabytes, not gigabytes.

* All of these add up to faster and simpler **automation**

## Limitations of Containers

* **Less flexibility** than VMs - You can't run a Windows container on a Linux machine (yet).

* Introduces **new challenges** around orchestration and automation.
