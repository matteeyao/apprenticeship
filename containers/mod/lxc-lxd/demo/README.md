# Installing LXC/LXD

## About this lab

This lab will allow you to practice installing LXC/LXD in a cloud server environment. You will pull down the latest Alpine image and create a container from it to test your configuration.

Your development team has asked for a cloud server with LXC/LXD configured. To meet this requirement, initialize LXD in your environment and create a new container called "My Container" using the Alpine images.

**Update**: Use Alpine version 3.14 in the lab.
