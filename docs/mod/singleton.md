# Singleton

**Singleton** is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## Problem

The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the *Single Responsibility Principle*:

1. **Ensure that a class has just a single instance.** Why would anyone want to control how many instances a class has? The most common reason for this is to control access to some shared resource-for example, a database or a file.

Here's how it works: imagine that you created an object, but after a while decided to create a new one.

Instead of receiving a fresh object, you'll get the one you already created.

Note that this behavior is impossible to implement w/ a regular constructor since a constructor call **must** always return a new object by design.

2. **Provide a global access point to that instance**.

Just like a global variable, the Singleton pattern lets you access some object from anywhere in the program. However, it also protects that instance from being overwritten by other code.

There's another side to this problem: you don't want the code that solves problem #1 to be scattered all over your program.

It's much better to have it within one class, especially if the rest of your code already depends on it.

## Solution

All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common:

* Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the `new` operator w/ the Singleton class.

* Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object.

If your code has access to the Singleton class, then it's able to call the Singleton's static method.

So whenever that method is called, the same object is always returned.

## Structure

![](../img/singleton-1.png)

The **Singleton** class declares the `static` method `getInstance` that returns the same instance of its own class.

The Singleton's constructor should be hidden from the client code. Calling the `getInstance` method should be the only way of getting the Singleton object.

## Pseudocode

In this example, the database connection class acts as a **Singleton**.

This class doesn't have a public constructor, so the only way to get its object is to call the `getInstance` method.

This method caches the first created object and returns it in all subsequent calls.

```c#
/* The Database class defines the `getInstance` method that lets
clients access the same instance of a database connection
throughout hte program. */
class Database is
    /* The field for storing the singleton instance should be
    declared static. */
    private static field instance: Database
    
    /* The singleton's constructor should always be private to
    prevent direct construction calls w/ the `new` operator. */
    private constructor Database() is
        /* Some initialization code, such as the actual
        connection to a database server. */
        // ...
    
    /* The static method that controls access to the singleton
    instance. */
    public static method getInstance() is
        if (Database.instance == null) then
            acquireThreadLock() and then
                /* Ensure that the instance hasn't yet been
                initialized by another thread while this one
                has been waiting for the lock's release. */
                if (Database.instance == null) then
                    Database.instance = new Database()
        return Database.instance
    
    /* Finally, any singleton should define some business logic
    which can be executed on its instance. */
    public method query(sql) is
        /* For instance, all database queries of an app go
        through this method. Therefore, you can place
        throttling or caching logic here. */
        // ...
        
    class Application is
        method main() is
            Database foo = Database.getInstance()
            foo.query("SELECT ...")
            // ...
            Database bar = Databasse.getInstance()
            bar.query("SELECT ...")
            /* The variable `bar` will contain the same object as
            the variable `foo`. */
```

## Applicability

Use the Singleton pattern when a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients; for example, a single database object shared by different parts of the program.

The Singleton pattern disables all other means of creating objects of a class except for the special creation method.

This method either creates a new object or returns an existing one if it has already been created.

Use the Singleton pattern when you need stricter control over global variables.

Unlike global variables, the Singleton pattern guarantees that there's just one instance of a class. Nothing, except for the Singleton class itself, can replace the cached instance.

Note that you can always adjust this limitation and allow creating any number of Singleton instances.

The only piece of code that needs changing is the body of the `getInstance` method.

## How to Implement

1. Add a private static field to the class for storing the singleton instance.

2. Declare a public static creation method for getting the singleton instance.

3. Implement "lazy initialization" inside the static method. It should create a new object on its first call and put it into the static field. The method should always return the instance on all subsequent calls.

4. Make the constructor of the class private. The static method of the class will still be able to call the constructor, but not the other objects.

5. Go over the client code and replace all direct calls to the singleton's constructor w/ calls to its static creation method.

## Relation w/ Other Patterns

* A **Facade** class can often be transformed into a **Singleton** since a single facade object is sufficient in most cases.

* **Flyweight** would resemble **Singleton** if you somehow managed to reduce all shared states of the objects to just one flyweight object. But there are two fundamental differences between these patterns:

1. There should be only one Singleton instance, whereas a *Flyweight* class can have multiple instances w/ different intrinsic states.

2. The *Singleton* object can be mutable. Flyweight objects are immutable.

* **Abstract Factories**, **Builders**, and **Prototypes** can all be implemented as **Singletons**.

## Usage of the pattern in C#

Singleton is a creational design pattern, which ensures that only one object of its kind exists and provides a single point of access to it for any other code.

Singleton has almost the same pros and cons as global variables. Although they're super-handy, they break the modularity of your code.

You can't just use a class that depends on Singleton in some other context.

You'll have to carry the singleton class as well. Most of the time, this limitation comes up during the creation of unit tests.

**Identification**: Singleton can be recognized by a static creation method, which returns the same cached object.

## Na√Øve Singleton

It's pretty easy to implement a sloppy Singleton. You just need to hide the constructor and implement a static creation method.

The same class behaves incorrectly in a multithreaded environment.

Multiple threads can call the creation method simultaneously and get several instances of Singleton class.

### Program.cs: Conceptual example

```c#
using System;

namespaces Singleton
{
    /* The Singleton class defines the `GetInstance` method that serves as an 
    alternative to constructor and lets clients access the same instance of 
    this class over and over. */
    class Singleton
    {
        /* The Singleton's constructor should always be private to prevent
        direct construction calls w/ the `new` operator. */
        private Singleton() { }
        
        /* The Singleton's instance is stored in a static fielld. There are 
        multiple ways to initialize this field, all of them have various pros
        and cons. In this example, we'll show the simplest of these ways, 
        which, however, doesn't work really well in a multithreaded program. */
        private static Singleton _instance;
        
        /* This is the static method that controls the access to the singleton 
        instance. On the first run, it creates a singleton object and places it
        into the static field. On subsequent runs, it returns the client
        existing object stored in the static field. */
        public static Singleton GetInstance()
        {
            if (_instance == null)
            {
                _instance = new Singleton();
            }
            return _instance;
        }
        
        /* Finally, any singleton should define some business logic, which can
        be executed on its instance. */
        public static void someBusinessLogic()
        {
            // ...
        }
    }
    
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // The client code.
            Singleton s1 = Singleton.GetInstance();
            Singleton s2 = Singleton.GetInstance();
            
            if (s1 == s2)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Singleton works, both variables contain the same instance.");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Singleton failed, variables contain different instances.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Thread-safe Singleton

To fix the problem, you have to synchronize threads during the first creation of the Singleton object.

### Program.cs: Conceptual Example

```c#
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace Singleton
{
    /* This Singleton implementation is called "double check lock". It is safe
    in multithreaded environment and provides lazy initialization for the
    Singleton object. */
    class Singleton
    {
        private Singleton() { }
        
        private static Singleton _instance;
        
        /* We now have a lock object that will be used to synchronize threads
        during first access to the Singleton. */
        private static readonly object _lock = new object();
        
        public static Singleton GetInstance(string value)
        {
            /* This conditional is needed to prevent threads stumbling over
            the lock once the instance is ready. */
            if (_instance == null)
            {
                /* Now, imagine that the program has just been launched. Since
                there's no Singleton instance yet, multiple threads can
                simultaneously pass the previous conditional and reach this
                point almost at the same time. The first of them will acquire
                lock and proceed further, while the rest will wait here. */
                lock (_lock)
                {
                    /* The first thread to acquire the lock, reaches this
                    conditional, goes inside and creates the Singleton
                    instance. Once it leaves the lock block, a thread that
                    might have been waiting for the lock release may then
                    enter this section. But sinve the Singleton field is
                    already initialized, the thread won't create a new object. */
