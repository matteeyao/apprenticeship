# VI. Conclusion

Super-Simple View Engine (SSVE) can do a few other simple things too, such as making decisions and looping over data.

As w/ the routing, the base of all knowledge is in [Nancy's official Wiki page](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/The-Super-Simple-View-Engine).

You have not even begun to dig into Nancyâ€™s builtin dependency injection container, nor have you delved into power user configuration of the framework by modifying the `Bootstrapper` class.

Nancy has a staggering amount of functionality, and it's cross platform too.

You can use Nancy quite happily under **the Mono framework** for running your apps and services on Linux and Macintosh machines.

It is possible also to use it w/ the newer .NET Core framework, but you have to jump through a few configuration hoops to do so.

Carter allows you to use NancyFX style route definitions in standard ASP.NET and .NET Core MVC. By using Carter, you get all the ease of use of Nancy while maintaining the backing of an enterprise runtime like .Net core.
