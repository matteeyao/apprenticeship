## IV. Performance Efficiency

> Ability to use compute resources efficiently to meet systems requirements while demands change and technologists evolve.

The Performance Efficiency pillar includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

### Design Principles

There are five design principles for performance efficiency in the cloud:

* Democratize advanced technologies

* Go global in minutes

* Use serverless architectures

* Experiment more often

* Consider mechanical sympathy

  * How a tool or system is best applied to the customer's business goals. Using the right tool for the right job effectively and cost-optimized

### Best Practices

Take a data-driven approach to building a high-performance architecture. Gather data on all aspects of the architecture, from the high-level design to the selection and configuration of resource types.

Reviewing your choices on a regular basis ensures you are taking advantage of the continually evolving AWS Cloud. Monitoring ensures you are aware of any deviance from expected performance. Make trade-offs in your architecture to improve performance, such as using compression or caching, or relaxing consistency requirements.

The optimal solution for a particular workload varies, and solutions often combine multiple approaches. AWS Well-Architected workloads use multiple solutions and enable features to improve performance.

## Learning Summary

* If data is unstructured, Amazon S3 is generally the storage solution.

* Use caching strategically to improve performance.

* Know when and why to use Auto Scaling

* Choose the instance and database type that makes the most sense for your workload and performance need.
