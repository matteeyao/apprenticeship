# Trusted Advisor

AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides you real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices. It inspects your AWS environment and makes recommendations for saving money, improving system performance and reliability, or closing security gaps.

Whether establishing new workflows, developing applications, or as part of ongoing improvement, take advantage of the recommendations provided by Trusted Advisor on a regular basis to help keep your solutions provisioned optimally.

Trusted Advisor includes an ever-expanding list of checks in the following five categories:

* **Cost Optimization** – recommendations that can potentially save you money by highlighting unused resources and opportunities to reduce your bill.

* **Security** – identification of security settings that could make your AWS solution less secure.

* **Fault Tolerance** – recommendations that help increase the resiliency of your AWS solution by highlighting redundancy shortfalls, current service limits, and over-utilized resources.

* **Performance** – recommendations that can help to improve the speed and responsiveness of your applications.

* **Service Limits** – recommendations that will tell you when service usage is more than 80% of the service limit.
