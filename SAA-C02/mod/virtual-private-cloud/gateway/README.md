# Gateway Endpoints and Interface Endpoints

You can use two types of VPC endpoints to access Amazon S3: gateway endpoints and interface endpoints. A gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify in your route table to access Amazon S3 from your VPC over the AWS network. Interface endpoints extend the functionality of gateway endpoints by using private IP addresses to route requests to Amazon S3 from within your VPC, on-premises, or from a different AWS Region. Interface endpoints are compatible with gateway endpoints. If you have an existing gateway endpoint in the VPC, you can use both types of endpoints in the same VPC.

There is no additional charge for using gateway endpoints. However, standard charges for data transfer and resource usage still apply.

You pay an hourly rate for every provisioned Interface endpoint.
