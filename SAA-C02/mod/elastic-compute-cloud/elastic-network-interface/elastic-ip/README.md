# Private, Public, and Elastic IPs

## Elastic IP

An Elastic IP address doesn’t incur charges as long as the following conditions are true:

* The Elastic IP address is associated with an Amazon EC2 instance.

* The instance associated with the Elastic IP address is running.

* The instance has only one Elastic IP address attached to it.

If you’ve stopped or terminated an EC2 instance with an associated Elastic IP address and you don’t need that Elastic IP address anymore, consider disassociating or releasing the Elastic IP address.
