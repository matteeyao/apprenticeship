# AWS DataSync

## What is AWS DataSync?

AWS DataSync makes it simple and fast to move large amounts of data online between on-premises storage and Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), or Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. Manual tasks related to data transfers can slow down migrations and burden IT operations. DataSync eliminates or automatically handles many of these tasks, including scripting copy jobs, scheduling, and monitoring transfers, validating data, and optimizing network utilization. The DataSync software agent connects to your Network File System (NFS), Server Message Block (SMB) storage, and your self-managed object storage, so you donâ€™t have to modify your applications.

DataSync can transfer hundreds of terabytes and millions of files at speeds up to 10 times faster than open-source tools, over the Internet or AWS Direct Connect links. You can use DataSync to migrate active data sets or archives to AWS, transfer data to the cloud for timely analysis and processing, or replicate data to AWS for business continuity. Getting started with DataSync is easy: deploy the DataSync agent, connect it to your file system, select your AWS storage resources, and start moving data between them. You pay only for the data you move.

Since the problem is mainly about moving historical records from on-premises to AWS, using AWS DataSync is a more suitable solution. You can use DataSync to move cold data from expensive on-premises storage systems directly to durable and secure long-term storage, such as Amazon S3 Glacier or Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

> A way of sinking your data to AWS.

DataSync allows you to move large amounts of data into AWS, and is used on a on-premise data center. You'd install the DataSync agent as an agent on a server that connects to your NAS or file system that will then copy data to AWS and write data from AWS. It's a way of synchronizing your data and it automatically encrypts your data and accelerates transfer over the wide area network (WAN). It performs automatic data integrity checks in transit and at rest as well. Seamlessly connects to Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, or Amazon FSx for Windows File Server to copy data and metadata to and from AWS.

AWS DataSync makes it simple and fast to move large amounts of data online between on-premises storage and Amazon S3. DataSync manages many of the tasks related to data transfers that can slow down migrations. You can also reduce the burden of your IT operations, including running your own instances, handling encryption, managing scripts, network optimization, and data integrity validation.

## Learning summary

AWS DataSync does not work with Amazon EBS volumes. DataSync can copy data between Network File System (NFS) shares, Server Message Block (SMB) shares, self-managed object storage, AWS Snowcone, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems, and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems.

* Used to move **large amounts** of data from on-premises to AWS.

* Used w/ **NFS**- and **SMB**-compatible file systems.

* **Replication** can be done hourly, daily, or weekly.

* Install the **DataSync agent** to start the replication.

* Can be used to replicate **EFS** to **EFS**.

    * Through this method, you would install the DataSync agent on an EC2 instance that was connected to a EFS and then you can use that DataSync agent to replicate your EFS to another copy or another EFS in the cloud.
