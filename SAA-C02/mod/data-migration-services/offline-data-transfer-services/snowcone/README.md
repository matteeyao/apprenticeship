# AWS Snowcone

**AWS Snowcone** is the smallest member of the AWS Snow Family of edge computing, edge storage, and data transfer devices, weighing in at 4.5 pounds (2.1 kg) w/ 8 terabytes of usable storage. You can run compute applications at the edge, and ship the device w/ data to AWS for offline data transfer, or you can transfer data online w/ **AWS DataSync** from edge locations

Snowcone has multiple layers of security and encryption. You can use it to collect, process, and transfer data to Amazon S3. **Snowcone** is designed for data migration needs up to dozens of terabytes (w/ up to 8 terabytes per device) and from space-constrained environments where **AWS Snowball** devices will not fit.
