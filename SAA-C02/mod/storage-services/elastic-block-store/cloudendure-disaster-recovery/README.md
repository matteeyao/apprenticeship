# CloudEndure Disaster Recovery and AWS Application Migration Service

Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon EBS volumes are key services as part of the CloudEndure Disaster Recovery and CloudEndure Migration services on AWS.

## CloudEndure Disaster Recovery

CloudEndure Disaster Recovery minimizes downtime and data loss by providing fast, reliable recovery of physical, virtual, and cloud-based servers into AWS Cloud, including public Regions, AWS GovCloud (US), and AWS Outposts.

You can use CloudEndure Disaster Recovery to protect your most critical databases, including Oracle, MySQL, and SQL Server, and enterprise applications such as SAP.

CloudEndure Disaster Recovery continuously replicates your machines (including operating system, system state configuration, databases, applications, and files) into a low-cost staging area in your target AWS account and preferred Region. In the case of a disaster, you can instruct CloudEndure Disaster Recovery to automatically launch thousands of your machines in their fully provisioned state in minutes.

By replicating your machines into a low-cost staging area while still being able to launch fully provisioned machines within minutes, CloudEndure Disaster Recovery can significantly reduce the cost of your disaster recovery infrastructure.

## AWS Application Migration Service

AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN), formerly CloudEndure Migration, is a highly automated lift-and-shift (rehost) solution that simplifies, expedites, and reduces the cost of migrating applications to AWS Cloud, including public Regions, AWS GovCloud (US), and AWS Outposts.

You can use AWS MGN to quickly lift-and-shift physical, virtual, or cloud servers without compatibility issues, performance impact, or long cutover windows. AWS MGN continuously replicates your source servers to your AWS account. Then, when youâ€™re ready to migrate, it automatically converts and launches your servers on AWS so you can quickly benefit from the cost savings, productivity, resilience, and agility of the AWS Cloud.

Once your applications are running on AWS, you can use a wide-range of AWS services  and capabilities to quickly replatform or refactor your applications. The lift-and-shift migration methodology provides a fast route for moving to the AWS Cloud without waiting to first modernize your applications.
