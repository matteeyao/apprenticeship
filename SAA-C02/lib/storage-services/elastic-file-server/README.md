# Elastic File Server

1. A data analytics company has been building its new generation big data and analytics platform on their AWS cloud infrastructure. They need a storage service that provides the scale and performance that their big data applications require such as high throughput to compute nodes coupled with read-after-write consistency and low-latency file operations. In addition, their data needs to be stored redundantly across multiple AZs and allows concurrent connections from multiple EC2 instances hosted on multiple AZs.   

Which of the following AWS storage services will you use to meet this requirement?

[ ] S3

[ ] EBS

[ ] EFS

**Explanation**: In this question, you should take note of the two keywords/phrases: "file operation" and "allows concurrent connections from multiple EC2 instances". There are various AWS storage options that you can choose but whenever these criteria show up, always consider using EFS instead of using EBS Volumes which is mainly used as a "block" storage and can only have one connection to one EC2 instance at a time. Amazon EFS provides the scale and performance required for big data applications that require high throughput to compute nodes coupled with read-after-write consistency and low-latency file operations.

**Amazon EFS** is a fully-managed service that makes it easy to set up and scale file storage in the Amazon Cloud. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create file systems that are accessible to Amazon EC2 instances via a file system interface (using standard operating system file I/O APIs) and supports full file system access semantics (such as strong consistency and file locking).

Amazon EFS file systems can automatically scale from gigabytes to petabytes of data without needing to provision storage. Tens, hundreds, or even thousands of Amazon EC2 instances can access an Amazon EFS file system at the same time, and Amazon EFS provides consistent performance to each Amazon EC2 instance. Amazon EFS is designed to be highly durable and highly available.

> **EBS** is incorrect because it does not allow concurrent connections from multiple EC2 instances hosted on multiple AZs and it does not store data redundantly across multiple AZs by default, unlike EFS.

> **S3** is incorrect because although it can handle concurrent connections from multiple EC2 instances, it does not have the ability to provide low-latency file operations, which is required in this scenario.

2. A Solutions Architect is implementing a new High-Performance Computing (HPC) system in AWS that involves orchestrating several Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) tasks with an EC2 launch type that is part of an Amazon ECS cluster. The system will be frequently accessed by users around the globe and it is expected that there would be hundreds of ECS tasks running most of the time. The Architect must ensure that its storage system is optimized for high-frequency read and write operations. The output data of each ECS task is around 10 MB but the obsolete data will eventually be archived and deleted so the total storage size wonâ€™t exceed 10 TB.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution that the Architect should recommend?

[ ] Launch an Amazon DynamoDB table w/ Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) and DynamoDB Streams enabled. Configure the table to be accessible by all Amazon ECS cluster instances. Set the DynamoDB table as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the Amazon ECS cluster.

[ ] Set up an SMB file share by creating an Amazon FSx File Gateway in Storage Gateway. Set the file share as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the Amazon ECS cluster.

[ ] Launch an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) w/ Provisioned Throughput mode and set the performance mode to `Max I/O`. Configure the EFS file system as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the Amazon ECS cluster.

[ ] Launch an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system w/ Bursting Throughput mode and set the performance mode to `General Purpose`. Configure the EFS file system as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the Amazon ECS cluster.

**Explanation**: **Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)** provides simple, scalable file storage for use with your Amazon ECS tasks. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files. Your applications can have the storage they need when they need it.

You can use Amazon EFS file systems with Amazon ECS to access file system data across your fleet of Amazon ECS tasks. That way, your tasks have access to the same persistent storage, no matter the infrastructure or container instance on which they land. When you reference your Amazon EFS file system and container mount point in your Amazon ECS task definition, Amazon ECS takes care of mounting the file system in your container.

To support a wide variety of cloud storage workloads, Amazon EFS offers two performance modes:

* General Purpose mode

* Max I/O mode

You choose a file system's performance mode when you create it, and it cannot be changed. The two performance modes have no additional costs, so your Amazon EFS file system is billed and metered the same, regardless of your performance mode.

There are two throughput modes to choose from for your file system:

* Bursting Throughput

* Provisioned Throughput

With Bursting Throughput mode, a file system's throughput scales as the amount of data stored in the EFS Standard or One Zone storage class grows. File-based workloads are typically spiky, driving high levels of throughput for short periods of time, and low levels of throughput the rest of the time. To accommodate this, Amazon EFS is designed to burst to high throughput levels for periods of time.

Provisioned Throughput mode is available for applications with high throughput to storage (MiB/s per TiB) ratios, or with requirements greater than those allowed by the Bursting Throughput mode. For example, say you're using Amazon EFS for development tools, web serving, or content management applications where the amount of data in your file system is low relative to throughput demands. Your file system can now get the high levels of throughput your applications require without having to pad your file system.

In the scenario, the file system will be frequently accessed by users around the globe so it is expected that there would be hundreds of ECS tasks running most of the time. The Architect must ensure that its storage system is optimized for high-frequency read and write operations.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Launch an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with Provisioned Throughput mode and set the performance mode to `Max I/O`. Configure the EFS file system as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the Amazon ECS cluster.**

> The option that says: **Set up an SMB file share by creating an Amazon FSx File Gateway in Storage Gateway. Set the file share as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the Amazon ECS cluster** is incorrect. Although you can use an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server in this situation, it is not appropriate to use this since the application is not connected to an on-premises data center. Take note that the AWS Storage Gateway service is primarily used to integrate your existing on-premises storage to AWS.

> The option that says: **Launch an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system with Bursting Throughput mode and set the performance mode to `General Purpose`. Configure the EFS file system as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the Amazon ECS cluster** is incorrect because using Bursting Throughput mode won't be able to sustain the constant demand of the global application. Remember that the application will be frequently accessed by users around the world and there are hundreds of ECS tasks running most of the time.

> The option that says: **Launch an Amazon DynamoDB table with Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) and DynamoDB Streams enabled. Configure the table to be accessible by all Amazon ECS cluster instances. Set the DynamoDB table as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the Amazon ECS cluster** is incorrect because you cannot directly set a DynamoDB table as a container mount point. In the first place, DynamoDB is a database and not a file system which means that it can't be "mounted" to a server.
