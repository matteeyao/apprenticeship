# NAT Gateway

1.  A company runs a public-facing three-tier web application in a VPC across multiple Availability Zones. Amazon EC2 instances for the application tier running in private subnets need to download software patches from the internet. However, the instances cannot be directly accessible from the internet.

Which actions should be taken to allow the instances to download the needed patches? Select two.

[x] Configure a NAT gateway in a public subnet.

[x] Define a custom route table with a route to the NAT gateway for internet traffic and associate it with the
private subnets for the application tier.

[ ] Assign Elastic IP addresses to the application instances.

[ ] Define a custom route table with a route to the internet gateway for internet traffic and associate it with
the private subnets for the application tier.

[ ] Configure a NAT instance in a private subnet.

**Explanation**: A NAT gateway forwards traffic from the instances in the private subnet to the internet or other AWS services, and then sends the response back to the instances. After a NAT gateway is created, the route tables for private subnets must be updated to point internet traffic to the NAT gateway.

2. An application consists of multiple EC2 instances in private subnets in different availability zones. The application uses a single NAT Gateway for downloading software patches from the Internet to the instances. There is a requirement to protect the application from a single point of failure when the NAT Gateway encounters a failure or if its availability zone goes down.

How should the Solutions Architect redesign the architecture to be more highly available and cost-effective

[ ] Create two NAT Gateways in each availability zone. Configure the route table in each public subnet to ensure that instances use the NAT Gateway in the same availability zone.

[ ] Create a NAT Gateway in each availability zone. Configure the route table in each public subnet to ensure that instances use the NAT Gateway in the same availability zone.

[ ] Create three NAT Gateways in each availability zone. Configure the route table in each private subnet to ensure that instances use the NAT Gateway in the same availability zone.

[x] Create a NAT Gateway in each availability zone. Configure the route table in each private subnet to ensure that instances use the NAT Gateway in the same availability zone

**Explanation**: A **NAT Gateway** is a highly available, managed Network Address Translation (NAT) service for your resources in a private subnet to access the Internet. NAT gateway is created in a specific Availability Zone and implemented with redundancy in that zone.

You must create a NAT gateway on a public subnet to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the Internet or other AWS services, but prevent the Internet from initiating a connection with those instances.

If you have resources in multiple Availability Zones and they share one NAT gateway, and if the NAT gatewayâ€™s Availability Zone is down, resources in the other Availability Zones lose Internet access. To create an Availability Zone-independent architecture, create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone and configure your routing to ensure that resources use the NAT gateway in the same Availability Zone.

> The option that says: **Create a NAT Gateway in each availability zone. Configure the route table in each public subnet to ensure that instances use the NAT Gateway in the same availability zone** is incorrect because you should configure the route table in the private subnet and not the public subnet to associate the right instances in the private subnet.

> The options that say: **Create two NAT Gateways in each availability zone. Configure the route table in each public subnet to ensure that instances use the NAT Gateway in the same availability zone** and **Create three NAT Gateways in each availability zone. Configure the route table in each private subnet to ensure that instances use the NAT Gateway in the same availability zone** are both incorrect because a single NAT Gateway in each availability zone is enough. NAT Gateway is already redundant in nature, meaning, AWS already handles any failures that occur in your NAT Gateway in an availability zone.
