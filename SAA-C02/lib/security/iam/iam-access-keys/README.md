# IAM Access Keys

A Solutions Architect created a brand new IAM User with a default setting using AWS CLI. This is intended to be used to send API requests to Amazon S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, and other AWS resources of the companyâ€™s cloud infrastructure.

Which of the following must be done to allow the user to make API calls to the AWS resources?

[ ] Enable Multi-Factor Authentication for the user.

[ ] Create a set of Access Keys for the user and attach the necessary permissions.

[ ] Assign an IAM Policy to the user to allow it to send API calls.

[ ] Do nothing as the IAM User is already capable of sending API calls to your AWS resources.

**Explanation**: You can choose the credentials that are right for your IAM user. When you use the AWS Management Console to create a user, you must choose to at least include a console password or access keys. By default, a brand new IAM user created using the AWS CLI or AWS API has no credentials of any kind. You must create the type of credentials for an IAM user based on the needs of your user.

Access keys are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS account root user. You can use access keys to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API (directly or using the AWS SDK). Users need their own access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS from the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), Tools for Windows PowerShell, the AWS SDKs, or direct HTTP calls using the APIs for individual AWS services.

To fill this need, you can create, modify, view, or rotate access keys (access key IDs and secret access keys) for IAM users. When you create an access key, IAM returns the access key ID and secret access key. You should save these in a secure location and give them to the user.

> The option that says: **Do nothing as the IAM User is already capable of sending API calls to your AWS resources** is incorrect because by default, a brand new IAM user created using the AWS CLI or AWS API has no credentials of any kind. Take note that in the scenario, you created the new IAM user using the AWS CLI and not via the AWS Management Console, where you must choose to at least include a console password or access keys when creating a new IAM user.

> **Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication for the user** is incorrect because this will still not provide the required Access Keys needed to send API calls to your AWS resources. You have to grant the IAM user with Access Keys to meet the requirement.

> **Assigning an IAM Policy to the user to allow it to send API calls** is incorrect because adding a new IAM policy to the new user will not grant the needed Access Keys needed to make API calls to the AWS resources.
