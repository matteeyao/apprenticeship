# AWS Directory Service

1. A telecommunications company is planning to give AWS Console access to developers. Company policy mandates the use of identity federation and role-based access control. Currently, the roles are already assigned using groups in the corporate Active Directory.

In this scenario, what combination of the following services can provide developers access to the AWS console? (Select TWO.)

[ ] AWS Directory Service Simple AD

[ ] IAM Groups

[x] AWS Directory Service AD Connector

[x] IAM Roles

[ ] Lambda

**Explanation**: Considering that the company is using a corporate Active Directory, it is best to use **AWS Directory Service AD Connector** for easier integration. In addition, since the roles are already assigned using groups in the corporate Active Directory, it would be better to also use **IAM Roles**. Take note that you can assign an IAM Role to the users or groups from your Active Directory once it is integrated with your VPC via the AWS Directory Service AD Connector.

**AWS Directory Service** provides multiple ways to use Amazon Cloud Directory and Microsoft Active Directory (AD) with other AWS services. Directories store information about users, groups, and devices, and administrators use them to manage access to information and resources. AWS Directory Service provides multiple directory choices for customers who want to use existing Microsoft AD or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)â€“aware applications in the cloud. It also offers those same choices to developers who need a directory to manage users, groups, devices, and access.

> **AWS Directory Service Simple AD** is incorrect because this just provides a subset of the features offered by AWS Managed Microsoft AD, including the ability to manage user accounts and group memberships, create and apply group policies, securely connect to Amazon EC2 instances, and provide Kerberos-based single sign-on (SSO). In this scenario, the more suitable component to use is the AD Connector since it is a directory gateway with which you can redirect directory requests to your on-premises Microsoft Active Directory.

> **IAM Groups** is incorrect because this is just a collection of IAM users. Groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. In this scenario, the more suitable one to use is IAM Roles in order for permissions to create AWS Directory Service resources.

> **Lambda** is incorrect because this is primarily used for serverless computing.
