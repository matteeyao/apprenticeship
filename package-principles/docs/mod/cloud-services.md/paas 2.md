# Platform as a Service

Cloud platform services, also known as Platform as a Service (PaaS), provide cloud components to certain software while being used mainly for applications. PaaS delivers a framework for developers that they can build upon and use to create customized applications. All servers, storage, and networking can be managed by the enterprise or a third-party provider while the developers can maintain management of the applications

## PaaS Delivery

The delivery model of PaaS is similar to SaaS, except instead of delivering the software over the internet, PaaS provides a platform for software creation. This platform is delivered via the web, giving developers the freedom to concentrate on building the software w/o having to worry about operating systems, software updates, storage, or infrastructure

PaaS allows businesses to design and create applications that are built into the PaaS w/ special software components. These applications, sometimes called middleware, are scalable and highly available as they take on certain cloud characteristics

## PaaS Advantages

* Simple, cost-effective development and deployment of apps

* Scalable

* Highly available

* Developers can customize apps w/o the headache of maintaining the software

* Significant reduction in the amount of coding needed

* Automation of business policy

* Easy migration to the hybrid model

## PaaS Characteristics

PaaS has many characteristics that define it as a cloud service, including:

* Builds on virtualization technology, so resources can easily be scaled up or down as your business changes

* Provides a variety of services to assist w/ the development, testing, and deployment of apps

* Accessible to numerous users via the same development application

* Integrates web services and databases

## When to Use PaaS

Utilizing PaaS is beneficial, sometimes even necessary, in several situations. For example, PaaS can streamline workflows when multiple developers are working on the same development project. If other vendors must be included, PaaS can provide great speed and flexibility to the entire process. PaaS is particularly beneficial if you need to create customized applications

This cloud service also can greatly reduce costs and it can simplify some challenges that come up if you are rapidly developing or deploying an app


## PaaS Limitations & Concerns

* **Data Security**

  * Organizations can run their own apps and services using PaaS solutions, but the data residing in third-party, vendor-controlled cloud servers poses security risks and concerns. Your security options may be limited as customers may not be able to deploy services w/ specific hosting policies

* **Integrations**

  * The complexity of connecting the data stored within an onsite data center or off-premise cloud is increased, which may affect which apps and services can be adopted w/ the PaaS offering. Particularly when not every component of a legacy IT system is built for the cloud, integration w/ existing services and infrastructure may be a challenge

* **Vendor lock-in**

  * Business and technical requirements that drive decisions for a specific PaaS solution may not apply in the future. If the vendor has not provisioned convenient migration policies, switching to alternative PaaS options may not be possible w/o affecting the business

* **Customization of legacy systems**

  * PaaS may not be a plug-and-play solution for existing legacy apps and services. Instead, several customizations and configuration changes may be necessary for legacy systems to work w/ the PaaS service. The resulting customization can result in a complex IT system that may limit the value of the PaaS investment altogether

* **Runtime Issues**

    * In addition to limitations associated w/ specific apps and services, PaaS solutions may not be optimized for the language and framework of your choice. Specific framework versions may not be available or perform optimally w/ the PaaS service. Customers may not be able to develop custom dependencies w/ the platform

* **Operational limitation**

    * Customized cloud operations w/ management automation workflows may not apply to PaaS solutions, as the platform tends to limit operational capabilities for end users. Although this is intended to reduce the operational burden on end users, the loss of operational control may affect how PaaS solutions are managed, provisioned, and operated
