# SaaS: Software as a Service

Software as a Service, also known as cloud application services, represents the most commonly utilized option for businesses in the cloud market. SaaS utilizes the internet to deliver applications, which are managed by a third-party vendor, to its users. A majority of SaaS applications run directly through your web browser, which means they do not require any downloads or installations on the client side

## SaaS Delivery

Due to its web delivery model, SaaS eliminates the need to have IT staff download and install applications on each individual computer. W/ SaaS, vendors manage all potential technical issues, such as data, middleware, servers, and storage, resulting in streamlined maintenance and support for the business

## SaaS Advantages

SaaS provides numerous advantages to employees and companies by greatly reducing the time and money spent on tedious tasks such as installing, managing, and upgrading software

## SaaS Characteristics

There are a few ways to help you determine when SaaS is being utilized:

* Managed from a central location

* Hosted on a remote server

* Accessible over the internet

* Users not responsible for hardware or software updates

## When to use SaaS

SaaS may be the most beneficial option in several situations, including:

* Startups or small companies that need to launch ecommerce quickly and don't have time for server issues or software

* Short-term projects that require quick, easy, and affordable collaboration

* Applications that aren't needed too often, such as tax software

* Applications that need both web and mobile access

## SaaS Limitations & Concerns

* **Interoperability**.

  * Integration w/ existing apps and services can be a major concern if the SaaS app is not designed to follow open standards for integration. In this case, organizations may need to design their own integration system or reduce dependencies w/ SaaS services, which may not always be possible

* **Vendor lock-in**.

  * Vendors may make it easy to join a service and difficult to get out of it. For instance, the data may not be portable-technically or cost-effectively-across SaaS apps from other vendors w/o incurring significant cost or inhouse engineering rework. Not every vendor follows standard APIs, protocols, and tools, yet the features could be necessary for certain business tasks

* **Lack of integration support**.

  * Many organizations require deep integrations w/ on-premise apps, data, and services. The SaaS vendor may offer limited support in this regard, forcing organizations to invest internal resources in designing and managing integrations. The complexity of integrations can further limit how the SaaS app or other dependent services can be used

* **Data security**.

  * Large volumes of data may have to be exchanged to the data centers of SaaS apps in order to perform the necessary software functionality. Transferring sensitive business information to public-cloud based SaaS service may result in compromised security and compliance in addition to significant cost for migrating large data workloads

* **Customization**.

  * SaaS apps offer minimal customization capabilities. Since a one-size-fits-all solution does not exist, users may be limited to specific functionality, performance, and integrations as offered by the vendor. In contrast, on-premise solutions that come w/ several software development kits (SDKs) offer a high degree of customization options

* **Lack of control**.

  * SaaS solutions involves handing control over to the third-party service provider. These controls are not limited to the software-in terms of the version, updates, or appearance-but also the data and governance. Customers may therefore need to redefine their data security and governance models to fit the features and functionality of the SaaS service

* **Feature limitations**.

  * Since SaaS apps often come in a standardized form, the choice of features may be a compromising tradeoff against security, cost, performance, or other organizational policies. Furthermore, vendor lock-in, cost, or security concerns may mean it's not viable to switch vendors or services to serve new feature requirements in the future.

* **Performance and downtime**.

  * B/c the vendor controls and manages the SaaS service, your customers now depend on venders to maintain the service's security and performance. Planned and unplanned maintenance, cyber-attacks, or network issues may impact the performance of the SaaS app despite adequate service level agreement (SLA) protections in place
