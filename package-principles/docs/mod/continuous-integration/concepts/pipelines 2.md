# Pipelines

A CircleCI pipeline is the full set of processes you run when you trigger work on your projects. Pipelines encompass your workflows, which in turn coordinate your jobs â†’ all defined in your project configuration file

Pipelines represent methods for interacting w/ your configuration:

* Use the new API endpoint to trigger a pipeline

* Use pipeline parameters to trigger conditional workflows

* Access to `version 2.1` config, which provides:

  * Reusable config elements, including executors, commands and jobs

  * Packaged reusable config, known as `orbs`

  * Improved config validation error messages

  * Option to enable auto-cancel, within **Advanced Settings**, to abort workflows when new build are triggered on non-default branches
